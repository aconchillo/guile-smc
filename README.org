** Usage
   PlantUML (<http://www.plantuml.com/>) state machine compiler:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE scheme
  (let ((fsm (puml->fsm (current-input-port))))
    (format #t "output fsm: ~a~%" fsm)
    (format #t "transition table:~%")
    (pretty-print
     (hash-table->transition-list (fsm-transition-table fsm))
     #:display? #t)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

State machine validation:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE scheme
(let ((fsm (puml->fsm (current-input-port)))
  (format #t "validation report:~%")
  (pretty-print (fsm-validate fsm)))
#+END_EXAMPLE
